	When your God comes a calling\n
	and you face up to him.\n
	Will you then confess\n
	to man's greatest sin?\n
	The confession of mankind\n
	to God you now must tell,\n
	Lets hope that he's forgiving\n
	for we may all burn in hell.\n
	\n
	Bless me lord for I have sinned\n
	I lost the meaning of life,\n
	and everywhere I travelled\n
	I held a bloody knife.\n
	Who's is the knife? Who's is the blood? Don't know but they're not mine,\n
	you have not got the bottle\n
	but you paid and that's your crime.\n
	\n
	The beauty of the silverback\n
	with its great big ashtray hands. \n
	Crush a rhino's horn\n
	for medicine in far off lands.\n
	The biggest of all the cats\n
	you've a tiger for a rug,\n
	and for it's ivory tusks\n
	king elephant you will mug. \n
	\n
	They're only bloody animals! Who cares about the beasts?\n
	When they're all dead and gone\n
	we'll move on to bigger feasts.\n
	Take all the goodness from his land\n
	and yes you will endeavour.\n
	To keep a fellow man enslaved\n
	and diamonds are forever.\n
	\n
	Man's mean machine keeps rolling\n
	now which land will it spoil?\n
	He's got to feed his industry\n
	his land it has no oil.\n
	So he sets a brother against his brother\n
	they say that's what they need.\n
	The starving winners promised food\n
	whilst oil feeds corporate greed.\n
	\n
	When a human being is born\n
	it's vulnerable and nude.\n
	Just like any other animal\n
	It only thinks of food,\n
	but as a human grows\n
	and this I don't find funny,\n
	it's taught to worship\n
	honour\n
	love and kill for money.\n
	Live progressive\n
	stay minimal. Afm\n
	Luck and love to all! \n
	be good\n
	do good"}
